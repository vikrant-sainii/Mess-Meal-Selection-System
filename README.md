# Mess Meal Selection System


## Overview

The **Mess Master** project streamlines hostel mess management by integrating a user-friendly Flutter app with Firebase as backend. It offers real-time meal selection updates, secure user authentication, and dynamic data visibility for students and administrators.

This project was developed as part of the Design Thinking course (3 credits) by a diverse team of four students from different branches: Mechanical Engineering (ME), Data Science and Engineering (DSE), Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE), and Computer Science Engineering (CSE). We divided tasks among four of us from idea to survey and from learning to implementing it.

Our team division was strategic: Gurnoor Singh from DSE conceptualized the core idea, Agampreet Kaur from ECE took charge of compiling the detailed project report, Sahil Sharma from ME led the interaction with the hostel warden and conducted student surveys, while I (Vikrant Saini), representing CSE, took on the responsibility of developing the multi-platform Flutter/Dart application.

The resulting app seamlessly runs across Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows, effectively enhancing both the dining experience for hostel residents and the operational efficiency of mess management.

# How to Run
## 1.	Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

    cd your-repo-name


## 2.	Install dependencies
Run the following command to fetch all required Flutter packages:

    flutter pub get
  

## 3.	Configure Firebase
â€¢	Set up your Firebase project in the Firebase Console.

â€¢	Download your platform-specific config files (GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS, google-services.json for Android).

â€¢	Important: Do NOT commit these config files or the generated firebase_options.dart file to version control.

â€¢	Add these files locally to your project following FlutterFire setup guides.

## 4.	Run the app
Launch the app on your preferred device or emulator:

    flutter run



___

## Notes
â€¢	ðŸ”’ Keep your API keys and config files secure
  Never push Firebase config files or API keys to public repositories.
  
â€¢	.gitignore is configured to block sensitive files like firebase.json, firebase_options.dart, and platform-specific config files.

â€¢	Double-check commits before pushing to avoid exposing private data.
